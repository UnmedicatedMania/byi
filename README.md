## DISREGARD THIS ENTIRE FIRST PARAGRAPH IF YOU ARE NOT A SYSTEM
> First things first, imma say all the words inside my head, im fired up and tired of the way that things have been.  no. um, banger song but no this is important. we are aware that being diagnosed as a minor is very rare. However, we have been wondering about our identity since 7 [the first time we knew what idenities were], known pretty confidentally since 10 [when we found out what D.I.D. was via a family friend], and been diagnosed medically for a while now. now what i mean by "wondering", I mean: "i dont feel like one person", wondering why my beliefs tend to shift, drastically, at seemingly random, and things along that line. getting in trouble for things i "didn't do", not feeling fully in control, or like im spectating, or blacking out for hours, days, or weeks [mainly because we would suddenly not understand school or how to do any assignments (this was the big red flashing arrow that said something was wrong, as we were a straight A kid without struggle then a literal failure and back]. All that may sound very "duh" and surface level, and I know! I dont care to get into personal details, obviously! Just wanted to sound less like. hypocritical, i guess. back to the point! As I was saying, being diagnosed as a minor is rare, and to an already extremely rare disorder is straight up "i dont fucking believe you until proven otherwise" unlikely, especially on ponytown. Because of this, and the "popularity." of the issue we tend to stay away from other minors who claim to be systems[especially if you claim to be medically diagnosed]. Not because we thinkk you're faking.., but... hm. just know it's always in the back of our head.

we're a stable system[, with partial amnesia[forget]. depending on whos fronting when, and what happened, we may fully, partially, or not remember things. we also disassociate[zone out] without switching[changing front] a lot, and have brain fog[train of thought is easily lost]. i promise we're not stupid just a little slow in the head[a fucking dumbass].
also i slightly lied about being stable, more like semi-stable! mainly because bpd[borderline personality, not bipolar] is a bitch, but hey, we're super chill cause modern medicineee i love medicine i lve doctorsss i lovee it so muchhh!!! /gen!!! other stuff too but you dont need to know all that, wiggle waggles my toes

hi hello less serious!! dni list no matter who youre talking to!
- first off, endogenic, willowgenic, and otherwise non-traumagenic 'systems'! do not talk to me!
this is a DISORDER and fakers will be shot on sight! no, fictionkins, you do not count, because you are not systems!
- ex-friends[of any or all], you know why we aren't friends anymore! if we broke it off, and you feel like you've reflected and want to try again, feel free! with caution, of course! if you broke it off, you can try again[it wasnt our decision so wdrc], just know, yes we still have attachment issues, yes we still have that alter you dont like, and yes we are still medicated. i hope yall have great lives, but without us in it! xoxo (kisses hugs>_<)/lyrc.
- dark+proshipperss!
- prepubecent CHILDRENN EW EW!!! /hj we dont want to talk to kids we're almost an adult, thanks!

if 'iwec' is in any of our pony names it 100% means we're unmedicated [cough.], so please take that iwc seriously[thanks]!! okay BYE.
